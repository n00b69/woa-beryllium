# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pocophone F1

## Installing Windows

### Prerequisites
- [Modded OFOX recovery](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-beryllium/releases/tag/Recovery)

- [Windows on ARM image](https://arkt-7.github.io/woawin/)
  
- [Drivers](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-beryllium/releases/tag/Drivers)

- [UEFI image](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-beryllium/releases/tag/UEFI)

### Boot into OFOX recovery
> If your recovery has been replaced by the stock recovery, flash it again using
```cmd
fastboot flash recovery path\to\ofox.img reboot recovery
```

#### Enabling mass storage mode
> If it asks you to run it once again, do so
```cmd
adb shell msc
```

### Diskpart
> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT ERASE, CREATE OR OTHERWISE MODIFY ANY PARTITION WHILE IN DISKPART!!!! THIS CAN ERASE ALL OF YOUR UFS OR PREVENT YOU FROM BOOTING TO FASTBOOT!!!! THIS MEANS THAT YOUR DEVICE WILL BE PERMANENTLY BRICKED WITH NO SOLUTION! (except for flashing it with [EDL](edl.md))
```cmd
diskpart
```

#### Selecting the Windows partition
> Use `list volume` to find it, replace `$` with the actual number of **WINF1**
```diskpart
select volume $
```

#### Add letter to Windows
```cmd
assign letter x
```

#### Selecting the ESP partition
> Use `list volume` to find it, replace `$` with the actual number of **ESPF1**
```diskpart
select volume $
```

#### Add letter to ESP
```cmd
assign letter y
```

#### Exit diskpart
```cmd
exit
```

### Installing Windows
> [!Warning]
> DO NOT USE 24H2!!!

> Replace `path\to\install.esd` with the actual path of install.esd (it may also be named install.wim or 22631.2861.XXXXXXX.esd)

```cmd
dism /apply-image /ImageFile:path\to\install.esd /index:6 /ApplyDir:X:\
```

> If you get `Error 87`, check the index of your image with `dism /get-imageinfo /ImageFile:path\to\install.esd`, then replace `index:6` with the actual index number of **Windows 11 Pro** in your image

### Copying your boot.img into Windows
- Drag and drop the **rooted_boot.img** from the **platform-tools** folder into the **WINF1** disk in Windows Explorer, then rename it to **boot.img**.

### Installing Drivers
- Unpack the driver archive, then open the `OfflineUpdater.cmd` file (if an error shows up, run `OfflineUpdaterFix.cmd` instead)

> If it asks you to enter a letter, enter the drive letter of **WINF1** (which should be **X**), then press enter
  
#### Create Windows bootloader files
> If any error shows up, such as "Failure when attempting to copy boot files", open `diskpart` again and assign any new letter to **ESPF1**, then replace the letter `Y` in the next commands with the letter that you just added.
```cmd
bcdboot X:\Windows /s Y: /f UEFI
```

#### Enabling test signing
```cmd
bcdedit /store Y:\EFI\Microsoft\BOOT\BCD /set "{default}" testsigning on
```

#### Disabling recovery
```cmd
bcdedit /store Y:\EFI\Microsoft\BOOT\BCD /set "{default}" recoveryenabled no
```

#### Disabling integrity checks
```cmd
bcdedit /store Y:\EFI\Microsoft\BOOT\BCD /set "{default}" nointegritychecks on
```

#### Remove the drive letter for ESP
> If this does not work, ignore it and skip to the next command. This phantom drive will disappear the next time you reboot your PC.
```cmd
mountvol y: /d
```

### Reboot to fastboot
```cmd
adb reboot bootloader
```

#### Booting firstboot.img
> Download **firstboot-paneltype.img** for your device's panel and replace `path\to\firstboot-paneltype.img` with the actual path to the image
>
> Reboot to recovery and use `adb shell panel`  in the modified recovery if you forgot what panel you have

> [!Important]
> Remove your USB cable right after leaving the fastboot screen, or Windows may crash in the initial setup, which will then require a reinstall
```cmd
fastboot boot path\to\firstboot-paneltype.img
```

### Reboot to Android
Your device should reboot by itself after +- 10 minutes of waiting, after which you will be booted into Android, for the last step.
